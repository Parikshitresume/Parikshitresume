### Testing Engineer, Aidin Technologies Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore (Nov 2021 - July 2024)
- Developed and tested a Wearable Health Monitoring System for the **Gaganyaan mission**, which includes a wearable textile vest. **BioVest Electronics (BVE)** captures astronauts' physiological data, While the **Avionics Interface Unit (AIU)** collects this data and radiation levels from the Dosimeter (PERDAA) for transmission to the onboard **Mission Computer (MC)** through various communication interfaces on behalf of **DEBEL under AS9100 Rev. D compliance**.
- Tested the **Magnetic Torquer system**, which features a dual coil setup **(Coil-Main Coil-Redundant)**,each capable of producing a 12.5 A·m² dipole movement. It's Operating voltage spans from 26 V to 32.4 V DC, and incorporates a Zener protection circuits for safety and telemetry point status monitoring. An electrical interface is established using a D‑type9‑pin Connectorplug, all with in a mechanical envelope measuring less than **34mmx60mmx60mm** protection against back **electromotiveforce(EMF)** under AS9100Rev.Dcompliance.
- Designed and implemented **Illumination Testing Setup** to validate engineering, qualification, and flight models of **Four Pi Sun Sensors**.  This included the design of an automated Tilt Table with accuracy and precision of 0.01 degrees; the creation of a Python codetointerface a PC with the Keithley 2401 Source‑meter and an Arduino Mega 2560 via the RS‑232 Protocol and URAT protocol, respectively, to store Short Circuit current readings from 2 photocells, their Tilt and estimated Temperature readings. A Murata SCL3300‑D01 communicating via SPI protocol and two 1021 kOhm NTC Thermistors were connected to the Arduino to sense Tilt and Temperature, respectively. A Kalman Filter was implemented to process raw tilt readings. This setup will test a minimum of 18 Space Grade sun sensors under AS9100Rev.Dcompliance.
- Tested on a GNSS receiver with Rx‑toolssoftware. The system uses a Texas Instruments development kit connected to the computer configured through the COM Port under serial connection settings. The hardware ensures a stable 3.3V power supply to the GPS antenna for precise satellite geolocation under AS9100 Rev.D compliance.

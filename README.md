 Aidin Technologies Pvt LTD, Bangalore
 Testing Engineer
 Nov 2021‑ July 2024
 • Developed and Tested a Wearable Health Monitoring System for the Gaganyaan mission, which includes a wearable textile vest,
 BioVest Electronics (BVE), and an Avionics Interface Unit (AIU) Biovest captures astronauts’ physiological data While AIU Collects
 this data and radiation levels from the Dosimeter (PERDAA) for transmission to the onboard. Mission Computer (MC) through vari

 • Designed,installedandimplementedtheIlluminationTestingSetuptovalidateEngineering,QualificationandFlightModelsof Four
 Pi Sun Sensors. This included the design of an automated Tilt Table with accuracy and precision of 0.01 degrees; the creation of
 a Python codetointerface a PC with the Keithley 2401 Source‑meter and an Arduino Mega 2560 via the RS‑232 Protocol and URAT
 protocol, respectively, to store Short Circuit current readings from 2 photocells, their Tilt and estimated Temperature readings. A

 configured through the COM Port under serial connection settings. The hardware ensures a stable 3.3V power supply to the GPS
 antenna for precise satellite geolocation under AS9100 Rev.D compliance.
 • Conductedcircuit analysis and ComputedTPDValuesbyleveragingThermalresistancecalculations.
 • Proficiently reviewed Gerber files and net lists collaborating closely with the designer to ensure precision and quality control.
 • Performedreliability assessments on BEL projects (PDU, PS, IF, RPPS, SI logic), DEBEL projects (AIU, BVE) and RF projects involving
 (FR4 circuits) collaborating closely with the designer to ensure precision and quality control.
 • Contributed to the EMI/EMC testing of the Avionics Interface Unit of the Bio Vest Electronics Package to be used in the Gaganyaan
